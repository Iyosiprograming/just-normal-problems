# Just Normal Problems

Welcome to **Just Normal Problems**!  

This repository contains a collection of complex exam-style questions that I tried my best to build **without AI**. Later, I used AI to refine them and make the best possible outcome. The main questions can be found in the [`todo.todo`](./todo.todo) file.

## How to Use

1. Open the [`todo.todo`](./todo.todo) file to see the questions.
2. Attempt solving them on your own.
3. Compare your solutions or use them as practice material.
